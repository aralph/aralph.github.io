## Overview

As lead ML engineer for detection on edge devices at Scandit, I developed MatrixScan, a high-performance computer vision solution that enables real-time barcode and text detection directly on mobile devices.

## Key Achievements

- **Launched real-time ML model** for image segmentation running on 1M+ mobile devices monthly
- **Trained binary neural networks** for smartphones with 30x less memory usage
- **Developed multi-stage training algorithms** reducing model size by 50% at same quality
- **Introduced Python coding guidelines** and company-wide Request for Change process

## Technical Stack

- **C++** - High-performance mobile runtime implementation
- **Python** - ML model development and training pipelines
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework for neural network development

## Technical Innovation

MatrixScan represents a breakthrough in mobile computer vision, delivering enterprise-grade barcode scanning performance directly on consumer smartphones. The system uses advanced neural network compression techniques and optimized inference engines to achieve real-time performance while maintaining exceptional accuracy.

## Mobile Optimization

The solution required innovative approaches to neural network quantization and mobile GPU optimization, enabling complex computer vision tasks to run efficiently on resource-constrained mobile devices without compromising user experience.
