## Overview

As tech lead of the product recognition team at Scandit, I led the development of ShelfView, an AI-powered solution that helps retailers understand what products are on their shelves through computer vision.

## Key Achievements

- **Built large-scale object detection and classification pipelines** validated with US retailer testsets
- **Led visual search product development** that scaled to >1M images/day with 10 customer pilots
- **Increased end-to-end accuracy from 40% to 90%** within 18 months through systematic improvements
- **Grew project squad from 2 to 7 engineers** with mentoring and technical leadership

## Technical Stack

- **Python** - Primary development language for ML pipelines
- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework for computer vision models
- **Django** - Backend API development
- **GCP** - Cloud infrastructure and ML services

## Product Impact

ShelfView revolutionizes retail operations by providing real-time shelf monitoring, planogram compliance checking, and inventory management through advanced computer vision technology. The system processes millions of images daily, helping major retailers optimize their shelf space and reduce out-of-stock scenarios.
