## Overview

During my research internship at CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) in Brisbane, Australia, I conducted cutting-edge research on autonomous navigation for large vehicles operating in complex, unstructured environments.

## Research Focus

- **Autonomous navigation research** for large vehicles on industrial sites using stereo cameras
- **Designed vision and LIDAR sensor fusion algorithms** for robust obstacle avoidance
- **Developed ground detection algorithms** for distinguishing navigable terrain from obstacles
- **Published research** on clear path detection in vehicle navigation (ICRA 2015)

## Technical Stack

- **C++** - Real-time robotics software development
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision and image processing
- **ROS** - Robot Operating System for sensor integration and control

## Research Innovation

The project focused on enabling autonomous vehicles to navigate safely through cluttered industrial environments by combining stereo vision and LIDAR data. This required developing novel algorithms for real-time terrain classification and obstacle detection in challenging outdoor conditions.

## Key Contributions

My research contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle navigation, particularly in the challenging domain of off-road and industrial site navigation where traditional road-based assumptions don't apply.

## Publication

The research resulted in a peer-reviewed publication at ICRA 2015, one of the premier conferences in robotics and automation, demonstrating the scientific rigor and impact of the work.
